Minimal-effort patched version of cudpp to allow using `cudppCompression` to work on `sm_61+` GPUs, since the original project seems to be dead. All other modules are deactivated. Since this is for a scientific benchmark, as few as possible modifications have been made to the original code. You probably want to use [some other fork](https://github.com/cudpp/cudpp/network) instead, since the original project seems to be abandoned.
